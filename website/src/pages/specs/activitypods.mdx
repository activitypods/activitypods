title: ActivityPods specificity
---

In this document, you can find descriptions for ActivityPods-specific APIs and protocol workflows. In the future, we will be contributing to related working groups, to bring the following specifications into official drafts.

### SPARQL endpoint

Every Pod comes with an SPARQL endpoint, linked to the WebID with the `void:sparqlEndpoint` predicate. Only SPARQL _queries_ are supported, not [SPARQL _updates_](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/) (You MUST use LDP or ActivityPub to modify data). WAC permissions are applied to all SPARQL queries, in order to return only the resources that the autenticated user or application has the right to see.

### Authentication

#### Proxy endpoint with non-GET methods

We have extended the [ActivityPub proxy endpoint](./activitypub#proxy-endpoint) to support HTTP methods others than GET.

To do that, you may pass a [`multipart/form-data``](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/Using_FormData_Objects) Content-Type with the following fields:

- `id`: The URI of the resource
- `method`: The HTTP method to use (default to `GET`)
- `headers`: The HTTP headers to pass to the request (in JSON format)
- `body`: The body of the request (optional)

#### Capabilities URL

To be implemented.

### Apps registration through ActivityPub

To be implemented.

### Announces / Announcers collections

To define.

### Collections API

In ActivityPub, [ActivityStreams collections](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#collections) are frequently used to handle side-effects. For example, when a `Follow` activity is sent, the actor is added to the `as:followers` collection. Collections have their own paging system. They can be ordered or unordered. Also, they can dereference the items they contain (this is the case for the inbox) or only display their URIs (like the `as:followers` collection).

However, no API has been defined to create custom collections or add/remove items from existing collections.

#### Create custom collection

ðŸ‘· To be implemented

In ActivityPods, ActivityStreams collections can be POSTed as regular LDP resources.

The `@type` can a `as:Collection` or a `as:OrderedCollection`, depending on weither you need items to be ordered or not.

In the case of a `as:OrderedCollection`, you must also indicate the `apods:sortField` and `apods:sortOrder`.

We have added a boolean `apods:dereferenceItems` in order to declare if the items should be dereferenced or not.

```json
{
	"@context": [
		"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
		{ "apods": "http://activitypods.org/ns/core#", "dc": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/" }
	],
	"@type": "OrderedCollection",
	"apods:sortField": "dc:created",
	"apods:sortOrder": "apods:AscOrder", // or "apods:DescOrder"
	"apods:dereferenceItems": true
}
```

It is then your responsibility to attach the newly-created collection to an actor or object.

#### Add or remove items

ðŸ‘· To be implemented ([#1165](https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/semapps/issues/1165))

It's possible to add items to (or remove items from) a collection using the `PATCH` method, the `application/sparql-update` Content-Type and a SPARQL query like this on the body:

```sparql
PREFIX as: <https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#>
INSERT DATA {
  <https://mypod.store/alice/followers> as:items <https://mypod.store/bob> .
};
DELETE DATA {
  <https://mypod.store/alice/followers> as:items <https://mypod.store/craig> .
}
```

For ordered collections, you should use the `as:orderedItems` predicate.

### Notifications

> TODO: https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/activitypods/issues/91

Apps can send notifications to Pod users like this:

```json
{
	"type": "Note",
	"actor": "https://welcometomyplace.org/data/app",
	"name": "Alice invites you to an event: my birthday party !",
	"content": "You have received an invitation from Alice",
	"url": [
		{
			"type": "Link",
			"name": "View",
			"href": "https://welcometomyplace.org/Event/{eventUri}/show"
		},
		{
			"type": "Link",
			"name": "Ignore future Alice invitations",
			"href": "https://welcometomyplace.org/Event/{eventUri}/show?action=ignore"
		}
	],
	"context": "https://mypod.store/alice/data/{uuid}"
}
```

They are translated into emails and push notifications.

### JsonLd header

It's a peculiarity of the JSON-LD format that, when creating a LDP resource, you can indicate the context you wish to use (using the `@context` field), but when retrieving an existing resource, you are obliged to adapt to the context provided by the server. Of course, we can then reformat to suit our needs, but this may have performance costs.

> This problem does not concern Solid providers who register data in the filesyste: they generally store and return the context provided at creation. However, when data is stored in a triple store, as is the case with ActivityPods, the initial context is lost.

To remedy this problem, all GET routes of our pods (whether for LDP resources, LDP containers or ActivityStreams collections) accept an optional `JsonLdContext` header, which can be either a URL or a JSON representation (of an array or object). As a result, the specified context will be used to format the returned JSON-LD data.

```http
GET /alice/data/my-event HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Accept: application/ld+json
JsonLdContext: https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams
```

Response:

```json
{
	"@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
	"id": "https://example.org/alice/data/my-event",
	"type": "Event",
	"name": "My event"
}
```
