title: ActivityPods specificity
---

In this document, you can find descriptions for ActivityPods-specific APIs and protocol workflows. In the future, we will be contributing to related working groups, to bring the following specifications into official drafts.

### Authentication

#### Proxy endpoint with non-GET methods

We have extended the [ActivityPub proxy endpoint](./activitypub.mdx#proxy-endpoint) to support HTTP methods others than GET.

To do that, you may pass a [`multipart/form-data``](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/Using_FormData_Objects) Content-Type with the following fields:

- `id`: The URI of the resource
- `method`: The HTTP method to use (default to `GET`)
- `headers`: The HTTP headers to pass to the request (in JSON format)
- `body`: The body of the request (optional)

#### Capability URL

We implement capability resources which are defined as [WAC](https://solid.github.io/web-access-control-spec/) Authorizations:

```json
{
  "@context": { "acl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#" },
  "@id": "https://myserver.com/capabilities/k3kleict5ks3r4",
  "@type": "acl:Authorization",
  "acl:accessTo": "https://myserver.com/resource/x",
  "acl:mode": "acl:Write"
}
```

Anyone who know the capability URL can access its corresponding resource like this:

```
GET /capabilities/k3kleict5ks3r4 HTTP/1.1
Host: myserver.com
Accept: application/ld+json
Authorization: Capability https://myserver.com/capabilities/k3kleict5ks3r4
```

The capability resource itself is not public, but it can be requested with its own URL in the `Authorization` header.

### Collections API

In ActivityPub, [ActivityStreams collections](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#collections) are frequently used to handle side-effects. For example, when a `Follow` activity is sent, the actor is added to the `as:followers` collection.
Collections have their own paging system. They can be ordered or unordered. Also, they can dereference the items they contain (this is the case for the inbox) or only display their URIs (like the `as:followers` collection).

However, no API has been defined to create custom collections or add/remove items from existing collections.

#### Create custom collection

👷 To be implemented ([#1166](https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/semapps/issues/1166))

In ActivityPods, ActivityStreams collections can be POSTed as regular LDP resources.

The `@type` can be a `as:Collection` or a `as:OrderedCollection`, depending on weither you need items to be ordered or not.

In the case of a `as:OrderedCollection`, you must also indicate the `apods:sortField` and `apods:sortOrder`.

We have added a boolean `apods:dereferenceItems` in order to declare if the items should be dereferenced or not.

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    { "apods": "http://activitypods.org/ns/core#", "dc": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/" }
  ],
  "@type": "OrderedCollection",
  "apods:sortField": "dc:created",
  "apods:sortOrder": "apods:AscOrder", // or "apods:DescOrder"
  "apods:dereferenceItems": true
}
```

There are [discussions in the fediverse](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/fep-5bf0-collection-sorting-and-filtering/3095) to specify these missing predicates.

#### Add or remove items

👷 To be implemented ([#1165](https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/semapps/issues/1165))

It's possible to add items to (or remove items from) a collection using the [SparqlPatch](solid.mdx#patch-method) method, the `application/sparql-update` Content-Type and a SPARQL query like this on the body:

```sparql
PREFIX as: <https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#>
INSERT DATA {
  <https://mypod.store/alice/followers> as:items <https://mypod.store/bob> .
};
DELETE DATA {
  <https://mypod.store/alice/followers> as:items <https://mypod.store/craig> .
}
```

For ordered collections, you should use the `as:orderedItems` predicate.

### Notifications

👷 To be implemented ([#91](https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/activitypods/issues/91))

Apps can send notifications to Pod users like this:

```json
{
  "type": "Note",
  "actor": "https://welcometomyplace.org/data/app",
  "name": "Alice invites you to an event: my birthday party !",
  "content": "You have received an invitation from Alice",
  "url": [
    {
      "type": "Link",
      "name": "View",
      "href": "https://welcometomyplace.org/Event/{eventUri}/show"
    },
    {
      "type": "Link",
      "name": "Ignore future Alice invitations",
      "href": "https://welcometomyplace.org/Event/{eventUri}/show?action=ignore"
    }
  ],
  "context": "https://mypod.store/alice/data/{uuid}"
}
```

They will be translated into emails and, possibly, push notifications.

### JsonLdContext header

It's a peculiarity of the JSON-LD format that, when creating a LDP resource, you can indicate the context you wish to use (using the `@context` field), but when retrieving an existing resource, you are obliged to adapt to the context provided by the server. Of course, we can then reformat to suit our needs, but this may have performance costs.

> This problem does not concern Solid providers who register data in the filesyste: they generally store and return the context provided at creation. However, when data is stored in a triple store, as is the case with ActivityPods, the initial context is lost.

To remedy this problem, all GET routes of our pods (whether for LDP resources, LDP containers or ActivityStreams collections) accept an optional `JsonLdContext` header, which can be either a URL or a JSON representation (of an array or object). As a result, the specified context will be used to format the returned JSON-LD data.

```
GET /alice/data/my-event HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Accept: application/ld+json
JsonLdContext: https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://example.org/alice/data/my-event",
  "type": "Event",
  "name": "My event"
}
```

There are [discussions](https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/semapps/issues/1204) about using more standards headers.

### Discovery

#### Identifying application actors

In ActivityPods, applications are also ActivityPub actor.

To find the actor linked with an application, we have implemented the [FEP-2677](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/2677/fep-2677.md)
