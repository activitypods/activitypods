import ProgressBar from '../../components/ProgressBar.astro';

Apart from a few side-effects which would be quick to implement if need arised, ActivityPods is 100% compatible with ActivityPub, and supports both client-to-server and server-to-server interactions.

### Outbox <ProgressBar percentage={100} />

### Inbox <ProgressBar percentage={100} />

### Side effects <ProgressBar percentage={70} />

#### Create/Update/Delete <ProgressBar percentage={100} />

It's possible to create, update or delete any kind of objects. Objects are automatically stored in the corresponding containers.

#### Follow <ProgressBar percentage={100} />

Every ActivityStreams actor is automatically attached `as:followers` and `as:following` collections. Whenever a Follow activity is detected, it will add

The `Undo > Follow` activity is also supported.

#### Like <ProgressBar percentage={100} />

Every ActivityStreams actor is automatically attached a `as:liked` collection

Every ActivityStreams object is automatically attached a `as:likes` collection, as soon as a Like is detected (?). If you want non-ActivityStreams objects to have a `as:likes` collection, you should add the type `as:Object` to the resource (TODO).

The `Undo > Like` activity is also supported.

#### Announce <ProgressBar percentage={0} />

The `as:shares` is not implemented yet. However we have a custom `apods:announces` and `apods:announcers` collections (see below).

#### Add/Remove <ProgressBar percentage={0} />

Not implemented yet.

#### Block <ProgressBar percentage={0} />

Not implemented yet.

### Authentication <ProgressBar percentage={70} />

#### HTTP Signature <ProgressBar percentage={100} />

HTTP signature is the [recommended](https://www.w3.org/wiki/SocialCG/ActivityPub/Authentication_Authorization#Signing_requests_using_HTTP_Signatures) way to authenticate for server-to-server ActivityPub interactions. It is generally used when POSTing to other inboxes. We have extended its use so that it can be used on any endpoint, including LDP routes.

#### Linked Data Signature <ProgressBar percentage={0} />

In addition to HTTP signature, it is [recommended](https://www.w3.org/wiki/SocialCG/ActivityPub/Authentication_Authorization#Linked_Data_Signatures) to also implement Linked Data Signatures. This is implemented by only a few ActivityPub-compatible softwares (notably Mastodon), and none enforces it at the moment.

Not implemented yet. ([#321](https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/semapps/issues/321))

### Proxy endpoint <ProgressBar percentage={100} />

The [ActivityPub specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#actor-objects) mentions a `as:proxyUrl` predicate (included in the `as:endpoint` predicate of the actor) with the following description:

> Endpoint URI so this actor's clients may access remote ActivityStreams objects which require authentication to access. To use this endpoint, the client posts an ` x-www-form-urlencoded`` id parameter with the value being the  `id` of the requested ActivityStreams object.

We have implemented this endpoint, and we have extended it for non-GET methods using the `multipart/form-data` Content-Type ([see the related ActivityPods section](./activitypods#proxy-endpoint-with-non-get-methods)).
